## I have forked the designated remote GitHub repository and

## In the "makeCacheMatrix" portion of the exercise we want to
## create the "input" matrix for the "cacheSolve" part of the
## assignment.

## Specifically, "makeCacheMatrix"


makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {

}


## Write a short comment describing this function

cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
        ## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'
}
